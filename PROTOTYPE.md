# Section 1: Description


  PERIOD 3
  Group members names: Leonardo Benitez and Vanna Lei

  Group Name (be creative and lean into it!) BlockBlastBananas
  Brief Project description (1 paragraph summary):
      - Our group is going to recreate the amazing Block Blast Game. There will be 2 different game modes: one that starts with an empty board and another one with random pieces
      filled in. There were be three random pieces generated for you to fit in the board. You will use arrow keys (or drag and drop if we have time) to move the pieces onto the board.
      The row gets cleared and you get points after the row is filled with blocks, just like the game. The score will be placed on the top and it will also account for combos.

  Critical features (Minimum Viable Product) - What you want to have after 1.5 weeks.
     - After 1.5 weeks, our MVP would be the creation of game board, pieces, random piece generator, and an attempt to move and place blcoks.

  Nice to have features - What you would want to have by the end
     - Drag and drop blocks instead of moving them using arrow keys; different themes/game modes.

# Section 3: Development Phases/Stages

**Section 3: Development Phases/Stages**

**Phase 1: Game Board and Block Basics (Days 1–5)**

* Build 8x8 board using a 2D array and display it
* Create basic block shapes and store them as arrays
* Add ability to place blocks and update board state

**Phase 2: Random Blocks and Movement (Days 6–10)**

* Generate 3 random blocks from a fixed set
* Display blocks and allow arrow key movement
* Prevent illegal placements (overlaps, out-of-bounds)

**Phase 3: Row Clearing and Scoring (Days 11–14)**

* Add logic to detect and clear full rows
* Implement scoring system (rows cleared + combos)
* Show score at the top of the screen

**Phase 4: Game Modes and Polishing (Days 15–20)**

* Add Classic (empty board) and Challenge (pre-filled) modes
* End game when no blocks fit, show Game Over screen
* Clean up UI and basic styling

**Phase 5: Extra Features (Days 21–30)**

* Drag and drop for block movement
* Theme and color options
* Add local leaderboard and sound effects (if time)
