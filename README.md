# Project Description

Block Blast! Drag and drop your blocks to fill up rows and blast! The goal of the game is to try to earn as many points as possible and have fun! If your block somehow magically places to a position you didn't want it to be, don't worry! The hint is to make sure the top left block is placed accurately. :))

# Intended usage:

This project will be used to help students have fun. The moving blocks and rows clearing will be stimulating enough for students to enjoy themselves!
