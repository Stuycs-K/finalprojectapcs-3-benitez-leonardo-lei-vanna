# Project Description

Block Blast! Drag and drop your blocks to fill up rows and columns to have a blast! The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible, clearing rows and columns by filling them up with blocks! Think of it like tetris, but two dimensional and more time to think. Try to beat your high score, and see how you do compared to your friends!

# Intended usage:

This project will be used to help students have fun. The moving blocks and rows clearing will be stimulating enough for students to enjoy themselves!
